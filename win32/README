                           TinyFugue for Win32


The official release of TF for win32 is available only in source form.
To compile it, you will need the Cygwin Development Kit (cdk.exe),
available at http://www.cygnus.com/misc/gnu-win32/.  Once you have the
CDK installed, follow the instructions for compiling TF under UNIX.

Unofficial binary releases may be available.  Check
http://tinyfugue.sourceforge.net/ for more information.

There are several known problems with the win32 version of tf, mostly due
to shortcomings of cygwin:
 * Scrolling in visual mode is jumpy.
 * /quote ! (and code that calls it, like /sys) is not supported.
 * $COMPRESS_READ is not supported.
 * Nonblocking hostname resolution (%gethostbyname) is not supported.
 * The flash attribute (-af) does not work.


Note that TF (and all cygwin applications) use "//X" notation instead of
"X:" to indicate drives in paths, and slashes instead of backslashes
to separate path components.  For example, a DOS path of "C:\foo\bar"
should be written "//c/foo/bar" in cygwin.
