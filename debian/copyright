It was downloaded from:

    <http://tinyfugue.sourceforge.net/>

Upstream author:

    Ken Keys ("Hawkeye") <kkeys@ucsd.edu>

Additional upstream credits:

    Support for OS/2 was contributed by Andreas Sahlbach (asa@stardiv.de).

    TinyFugue versions 1.5.3 and earlier were written by Greg Hudson
    ("Explorer_Bob"), without whom I would have never gotten into this
    mess.

    TinyFugue was intially derived from tinytalk, a unix client written by
    Anton Rang ("Tarrant") and modified by Leo Plotkin ("Grod").

    Additional thanks to Jeff Prothero ("Cynbe"), Bruce Sterling Woodcock
    ("Bruce"), David Moore ("OliverJones"), Ben Jackson ("Ben"), the
    mudders of glia.biostr.washington.edu, and everyone else who tested,
    found bugs, or came up with suggestions, and to Jim Lick ("Jingoro")
    for providing tcp.com services.
