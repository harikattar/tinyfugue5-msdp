tf5 (5.0beta8-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update debhelper compatibility level to V7.
    - Use debhelper rule minimization with overrides.
    - List extra files to remove in debian/clean.
    - Install README via debian/docs instead of dh_installdocs argument.
    - Add ${misc:Depends} dependency.
  * Remove the tf5. prefix from packaging files.  We only generate one
    binary package and will for the forseeable future, so no need for the
    package prefix.
  * Remove old conflict on the pre-alternatives version of tf, which was
    older than what released with oldstable.
  * Update standards version to 3.8.3 (no changes required).

tf5 (5.0beta8-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Build with SSL support using the GnuTLS OpenSSL compatibility layer.
    (Linking against OpenSSL directly isn't allowed since TinyFugue is
    under the GPL without an exception.)
  * Remove all modified and created files in debian/rules clean.  The
    upstream distclean wasn't comprehensive.
  * Update standards version to 3.8.0 (no changes required).

tf5 (5.0beta8-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Correct the patch for format handling on 64-bit platforms.  Patch
    from JP Sugarbroad.  (Closes: #478602)

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Tue, 29 Apr 2008 17:44:10 -0700

tf5 (5.0beta8-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New maintainer.  (Closes: #465935)
  * New upstream release.  (Closes: #457011)
    - Incorporated all Debian bug fix patches except DESTDIR support.
  * Apply bug fix from upstream tracker for format handling that mostly
    affects 64-bit platforms.
  * Revert several groff-specific modifications to the man page to keep it
    closer to the upstream version.
  * Overhaul the build system.
    - Stop using CDBS and its patch system.  (Closes: #424205)
    - Stop including detached debugging symbols.  Most packages don't do
      this and I don't think it's worth the disk space.
    - Pass configure the right options for cross builds.
  * Change package section to net, matching the installation path, and
    mention chatservers in the package description.
  * Add a menu file.
  * Add a watch file.
  * Add Homepage and Vcs-Git control fields.
  * Remove extraneous comments in postinst and prerm and run both in more
    situations, not only configure and remove.
  * Clean up build dependencies.
  * Rewrite debian/copyright using my standard format and include
    additional upstream credits and the PCRE license (included upstream
    but not used for Debian builds).
  * Update standards version to 3.7.3 (no changes required).
  * Update debhelper compatibility level to V5 (no changes required).

tf5 (5.0beta7-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Tell dh_strip to preserve debugging symbols stripped from the
    executable image so that they can be used via GDB's readlink
    mechanism (and, of course, ship them).
  * Added patch 002_strstr_needle_in_haystack, which fixes the 'calling
    replace with an empty match pattern causes an infinite loop'
    problem.
  * Cleaned up manpage to comply with modern (Unicode-aware) groff
    guidelines.

tf5 (5.0beta7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
    - Build with the system PCRE library now that doing so is supported.
    - Updated patches (several no longer needed, the rest all required
      significant modifications).
    - Update description to mention (the new) 256-color terminal support.
    - Upstream removed the manpage; import a copy of the last known state
      from version 5.0b6, rather than have Yet Another Manpage-less Program
      in Debian.
  * Updated to Standards-Version 3.6.2.0 (no changes)
  * Incorporate a fix for the /fg command on 64-bit systems by Zephaniah
    E. Hull (Closes: #327448)

 -- Joel Aelwyn <fenton@debian.org>  Tue, 20 Sep 2005 02:34:31 -0600

tf5 (5.0beta6-4) experimental; urgency=low

  * Added a Suggests on the 'spell' package, which provides a binary
    compatible with the spell.tf module.

 -- Joel Aelwyn <fenton@debian.org>  Mon, 31 Jan 2005 15:49:13 -0700

tf5 (5.0beta6-3) experimental; urgency=low

  * Disable OpenSSL support until Ken Keys either includes a license
    exception for linking GPL and OpenSSL code, or support for GNU TLS
    is available. Unfortunately, the OpenSSL emulation layer in GNU TLS
    isn't sufficient to handle what TF uses. (No bug)
  * Fixed alternatives handling to include manpage as a slave link, and
    moved manpage to tf5.1.gz natively. (No bug)
  * Added patch to fix SEGV fault in strip_attr() function. (No bug yet;
    filed request with upstream for proper fix)
  * Updated to Standards-Version 3.6.1.0 (no changes)

 -- Joel Aelwyn <fenton@debian.org>  Tue, 25 Jan 2005 13:52:49 -0700

tf5 (5.0beta6-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Added alternatives management for /usr/bin/tf, priority 15 (below
    'tf', which is the current stable release). (No bug)

 -- Joel Aelwyn <fenton@debian.org>  Tue,  4 Jan 2005 14:28:37 -0700

tf5 (5.0beta6-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Initial packaging (Closes: #265974)

 -- Joel Aelwyn <fenton@debian.org>  Fri, 20 Aug 2004 14:05:11 -0600
